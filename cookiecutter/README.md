# Using Cookiecutter (self-reminders)

On my zsh profile, I have an alias `cookies` that allows me to run `cookies {cookiecutter_foldername}` and build the corresponding cookicutter.

If on a machine that doesn't have that, execute `cookicutter https://github.com/tjsullivan1/tjs-scripts.git --directory="cookiecutter/$1"`
