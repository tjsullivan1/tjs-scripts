# Nuncpapyr

I created this tool for myself to generate a random link in my instapaper account. The name comes from the Latin word "Now" and "Papyrus", my riff on "Instapaper".

## Deployment

To deploy this project, you will need several environment variables, though we will accept them as command line arguments using typer as well.

They are:
- INSTAPAPER_KEY
- INSTAPAPER_SECRET
- INSTAPAPER_EMAIL
- INSTAPAPER_PASSWORD

## Demo

`nuncpapyr random` will return a URL for an article in your instapaper library. It will look something like this: https://www.instapaper.com/read/<id>
